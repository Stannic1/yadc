Features Implemented in Phase 2:

Virtual Terminal on IDE:
    Using docker, a virtual bash terminal has been set up on the IDE page. This allows
    the users to either program in the IDE or edit files directly in the terminal as if
    it were a native Linux BASH terminal.

Contest Question Generation:
    Two scripts, add_questions.py and question_generation.sh are used to automate
    the addition of contest questions to the SQLite database. add_questions.py prompts
    the user for question information and creates a question_list.txt file with SQLite
    friendly commands. The question list is then applied by running question_generation.sh.

User Experience Changes:
    Login / Logout feature was added to the site utilizing Django's authentication.
    User authentication has been added to prevent users from seeing incorrect links. This
    functionality will also be applied to preventing users from performing actions that
    require an authenticated user.
