Features Implemented in Phase 1:

Jordan's Tasks:
1. Database Setup:
	This task included setting up the models for the database tables for the 
	User, Question, Contest, and ParticipantScore tables. Models were defined in
	django and can be viewed in yadc/serverapp/core/models.py. Models were then
	migrated to the db.sqlite3 database and can be viewed using a sqlite tool
	such as sqlitebrowser.

2. Setup Registration:
	This task included using the User model that was created to allow users to
	register an account through the site. Refinement on the model for users will
	need to be updated later, but creating an account through the signup page 
	currently has complete functionality and created users can be viewed in the 
	db.sqlite3 database.
